        It’s a common struggle to not know what you’re doing when you step into
        the creator economy. It’s both a significant lifestyle change and a
        major mindset shift. <br /> <br /> They say you discover your true
        calling in times of a major life event. Suddenly, you realize the
        brevity of life and your desire to want something more out of it
        increases tenfold in a short time. <br />
        <br /> If you ever feel a strong desire to delve into the world of
        online creation and discover what you’re meant to do and what you want
        to do, the reasons I’m listing here will hopefully confirm it and enable
        you to take action.

        I started creating because I’d always loved teaching what I knew
      </div>
      <p id="518e" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Turns out people really like authentic views and your unique guidance on
        approaching this new thing is valuable to them.
      </p>
      <p id="0c8b" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        I was both surprised and excited at the opportunity. It began as an
        experiment and then quickly became a habit as I loved what I was doing.
      </p>
      <p id="7770" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        If you want to make yourself proud and feel good about providing a new
        piece of knowledge to the world, you’ll feel great creating on the
        internet.
      </p>
      <p id="d844" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        By dedicating time and effort to your own pursuits, you can experience a
        sense of pride and accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p id="2516" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        You’ll prioritize your own growth and well-being, and you’ll appreciate

        I wanted to find out if I could keep at it
      </h3>
      <p id="64dc" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Figure this: I’ve not missed writing on this website or my newsletter in
        the past year and a half.
      </p>
      <p id="0898" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        When I was just starting out, I was a bit apprehensive about not being
        able to maintain a schedule. A weekly or a bi-weekly or a monthly
        commitment to writing everyday scared me a little.
      </p>
      <p id="1e3e" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        But I was also excited to test myself out.
      </p>
      <p id="a316" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        I knew there will be difficult days ahead. I wish I could avoid them or
        wish them away but it doesn’t work like that.
      </p>
      <p id="9674" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        I just knew that working through them is the only way to keep the
        progress going. I learned a lot about myself: the habits, the urges, the
        determination, the inspiration, the resilience.
      </p>
      <p id="4ab4" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        You could end up learning a few new things about yourself that you’d
        never know if you didn’t start. So do it.
      </p>

        I wanted to get over the intimidation factor
      </h1>
      <p id="3f89" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Doing a thing over and over on the internet gets you noticed. And
        getting noticed gets you comments and you come under the public eye.
      </p>
      <p id="e603" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        There are both good and bad aspects of this inevitable scrutiny. I was a
        bit intimidated by it in the beginning.
      </p>
      <p id="f9d9" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Then after doing what I was doing for six months, I knew this was a part
        of the process.
      </p>
      <p id="5110" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Exposing your vulnerabilities can be intimidating, especially when
        you’re sharing your own ideas, thoughts, and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p id="4885" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Here’s the thing that I told myself then: if it was easy, everyone would
        do it.
      </p>
      <p id="2d44" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        The fear of making mistakes is real but it shouldn’t stop you from
        taking the first step or the next and the next.
      </p>
      <p id="a1ee" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Adversity is an essential part of the journey. If it wasn’t, we’ll never
        learn.

        I wanted to find out what it felt like to be an entrepreneur
      </h1>
      <p id="fca8" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        The world of entrepreneurship you see on social media can be both
        eye-opening and deceptive.
      </p>
      <p id="f9fe" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        The temptations of boundless freedom and financial flexibility seems
        like quite a reward. I’ve always wondered if reality would be different.
        So I stuck to what I was doing until I knew what it was like.
      </p>
      <p id="523d" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        It could be challenging for you at times when you’re starting out. It
        may require you to face similar challenges as your traditional job. Or
        it could be drastically different and make you feel alive.
      </p>
      <p id="d2ae" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        You’ll only know it when you try it.

        I wanted to understand what I’m good at
      </h1>
      <p id="e0e9" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        I didn’t figure out the exact topics to write and the precise ideas to
        share on day one. It was a journey.
      </p>
      <p id="fb06" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        As an engineer, there are hundreds of topics in software that I could be
        writing about and over time, I got good at identifying the ones I’d like
        writing over long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p id="7eb8" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        One of the most effective ways to understand your capabilities and your
        likes and dislikes is to step out of your comfort zone and put yourself
        to the test of becoming consistent.
      </p>
      <p id="20ce" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Nobody knows what they’d enjoy doing over a long period of time if they
        don’t experiment with a variety of things first.
      </p>
      <p id="97bb" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        Some could be lucky and get it on day 5 but a majority of us get on day
        31 or day 101.
      </p>
      <p id="8c33" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
        The bottom line is that it all begins with a decision to start and
        venture into unchartered territory.
      </p>
      <p id="7956" className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
